  "storyText": "Chapter 1: A Magical Potion\nRapunzel was hesitant about the strange bottle of ointment the vendor offered her. She didn't want to use something she knew nothing about, but she had to protect her skin from the sun. Looking at the vendor's kind eyes, she decided to take a chance and try the potion. She applied it to her skin and felt an instant cooling sensation. She thanked the vendor for the ointment and went on her way. As she walked back towards the beach, she noticed something different about herself. Her hair, which had been long and golden, now had a slight green tint. She realized that the potion must have some magical properties. Excited to experiment further, she set out to find more adventures."
