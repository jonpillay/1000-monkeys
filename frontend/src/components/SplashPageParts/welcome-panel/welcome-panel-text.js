export const welcomePara1 = "Welcome to the 1000 Monkeys laboratory, or 1000M as well call it around here. Standing at the intersection of creativity, scientific endeavour, and chaos - we’re at the bleeding edge of experimentation. We’ve assembled an army of monkeys and given each of them a typewriter and an art set. They’ve been trained in the art of writing and illustration and after a lot of patient wrangling, we’ve taught them some sign language (to differing effect). And so this is where you come in, we want you to be the author of these stories!"
export const welcomePara2 = "In all honesty, we haven't rounded up 1000 monkeys and put them to work in a laboratory. That would be a horrible thing to do, and we fully believe monkeys should be allowed to swing through the trees and not wear ties - as well as, it would be a logistical nightmare, and the smell might be the most lasting impression made. In reality 1000M labs is an experiment with Ai, a technological expression of the ‘Infinite Monkey Theorem’. But instead of primates with typewriters, we have an Ai engine made up of a number of Ai agents. Designed to take your ideas and turn them into exciting story books - with the only line between a masterpiece and complete drivel being the laws of probability."
export const welcomePara3 = "The experiment relies on one last factor, to find the gems in the dirt we need you to rate the output, a sort of crowd sourced quality control, so then we can order them so you can find the best of the crop. So that’s the sell, with your input, hopefully we stumble across something special. We’re just happy to have you here, see below for more information, or get stuck right in by logging in or activating your account if you haven’t done it already."
