<p>Welcome {{invitename}} to <b>1000 Monkeys!</b> You have Been Chosen to Lead a Special Adventure</p>

<p>1000 Monkeys is an interactive experiment into the ‘Infinite Monkey Theorem’ - an exploration of the idea that if enough monkeys, with enough typewriters, typed enough words, they would eventually stumble upon a masterpiece. The theorem’s logical backbone being that the intersection of chaos and time would eventually align to create something spectacular. A technological interpretation of this in the contemporary context is experimentation with AI - given enough GPT and Stable Diffusion (through Dream Studio) API calls, with enough material generated, and with enough user reviews, can a story that we could call something approaching spectacular be not only created, but also sorted from the chaff.</p>

<p>This is where you step in {{invitename}}. We need imagineers to spin us the yarns of the tales, the spice of the adventure - the prompts.</p>
